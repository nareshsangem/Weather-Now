#  Live Weather Map (React + Leaflet)

##  Overview
This project is an **interactive live weather map** built with **React** and **React-Leaflet**.  
It shows the **current weather at the user’s live location** (using browser geolocation),  
and allows users to **search for any city**. On search, the map **zooms in** to that location  
and displays weather details.  

A **green dot indicator** is shown on the user’s live location to indicate “Live”.
